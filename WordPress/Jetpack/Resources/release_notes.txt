Two-step authentication now comes with extra security. You'll need to unlock your device to approve or deny notifications.

When you head over to My Site > Comments, you'll see a fresh look and even fresher comment details, including:

- A sneak peek of the post title or parent comment, depending on whether the author left a comment on the post or replied to an existing comment
- Rich content so you can see each comment just as the author wrote it
- A share button for approved comments
- Visible email and IP addresses for comment authors with Administrator or Editor roles
- Tappable web address to visit the author's URL (instead of their avatar image)

Finally, we updated the UI for the Reply view, both minimized and fullscreen. Looking sharp!
