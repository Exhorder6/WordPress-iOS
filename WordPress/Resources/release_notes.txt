We have made life easier in the Block editor! There are dedicated embed blocks for YouTube, Twitter, WordPress, and Vimeo, which makes adding media super speedy — you can find them in the block picker view. The URLs can even be edited after you have selected them.

We have also tweaked the gallery block, so your images will still be added if you close the post while they are uploading.

Another fixed issue is the notification screen occasionally showing the wrong avatar when you are mentioned in a comment — your chosen image will now be proudly displayed!

But, if you are still having problems asking for help is even easier. You can do it right inside the editor screen: Just tap the  3-dot menu button, select “Help & Support”, then “Contact Support.”
