/// from the `Localizable.strings` files that are hosted in the app bundle instead of hosting their own `.strings` file.
///
/// Also, be sure to pass this function name as a custom routine when parsing the code to generate the main `.strings` file,
/// using `genstrings -s AppLocalizedString` so that this helper method is recognized. You will also have to
/// exclude this very file from being parsed by `genstrings`, so that it won't accidentally misinterpret that
/// routine/function definition below as a call site and generate an error because of it.
