We have made life easier in the block editor! There are dedicated embed blocks for YouTube, Twitter, WordPress, and Vimeo, which makes adding media very quick – you can find them in the block picker view. The URLs can even be edited after you have selected them.

We fixed an issue with the gallery block, so now your images will still be added if you close the post while they are uploading.

But, if you are still having problems, asking for help is even easier. You can do it right inside the editor screen: just tap the three-dot menu button, select “Help and support”, then “Contact support”.

Lastly, we fixed an issue where the notification screen was occasionally showing the wrong avatar when you are mentioned in a comment – your chosen image will now be proudly displayed!
