# We are in a special scenario in which `Gemfile.lock` points to a commit on
# `develop`, but `develop` has been renamed into `trunk`. `trunk` has new
# commits on since the lockfile was generated so, instead of updating the line
# above to point to `trunk` and rebundling, I'm pointing to a specific commit
# here.
